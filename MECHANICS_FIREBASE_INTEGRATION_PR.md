# [FEATURE] Mechanics Page Firebase Integration

## 📋 Overview
This PR integrates the mechanics dashboard page with real Firebase data, replacing hardcoded values with live data from the backend. The implementation provides mechanics with accurate, real-time information about their performance and upcoming appointments.

## 🎯 What This PR Does
- **Replaces hardcoded stats** with live Firebase data from the backend
- **Adds real-time updates** every 30 seconds to keep data current
- **Implements connection status monitoring** for Firebase connectivity
- **Enhances user experience** with loading states and error handling
- **Calculates real earnings** based on appointment duration and hourly rates

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Real Firebase Data Integration**
- **Today's Calls**: Now shows actual completed appointments for today (filtered by date)
- **This Week's Earnings**: Calculates real earnings based on appointment duration × hourly rate
- **Rating**: Already using real mechanic rating from Firebase
- **Appointments**: Enhanced with real-time data fetching

### **Real-Time Updates**
- **Auto-refresh every 30 seconds** to keep data current
- **Timer-based updates** for appointments and stats
- **Proper cleanup** when component is disposed
- **Background updates** without user intervention

### **Connection Status Monitoring**
- **Visual connection indicator** when Firebase is disconnected
- **Retry functionality** for failed requests
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Automatic reconnection** attempts

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Loading states** for stats cards with spinners
- **Error handling** with retry buttons
- **Connection status** notifications
- **Smooth data transitions** between loading and loaded states

## 🧪 Testing
- [x] **Real-time data updates** working correctly
- [x] **Connection status monitoring** functioning properly
- [x] **Error handling** for Firebase connectivity issues
- [x] **Loading states** displaying correctly
- [x] **Stats calculations** accurate with real data
- [x] **Appointment filtering** by date working properly

## 📝 Code Changes

### **Files Modified**
- `lib/screens/mechanic/mechanic_dashboard_screen.dart`

### **Key Changes**
1. **Added real Firebase data variables**:
   ```dart
   int _todayCalls = 0;
   double _thisWeekEarnings = 0.0;
   bool _loadingStats = false;
   bool _isConnected = true;
   Timer? _refreshTimer;
   ```

2. **Implemented real-time data loading**:
   ```dart
   Future<void> _loadRealStats() async {
     // Fetch appointments from Firebase
     // Filter by date for today's calls
     // Calculate earnings for this week
     // Update UI with real data
   }
   ```

3. **Added connection status monitoring**:
   ```dart
   // Connection status indicator
   if (!_isConnected)
     Container(
       // Visual indicator for disconnected state
       // Retry button functionality
     )
   ```

4. **Enhanced stats cards with loading states**:
   ```dart
   _buildStatCard(
     'Today\'s Calls',
     _loadingStats ? '...' : '$_todayCalls',
     Icons.videocam,
     Colors.blue,
     isLoading: _loadingStats,
   )
   ```

## 🚀 Benefits
- **Accurate Data**: Mechanics see real performance metrics
- **Real-Time Updates**: Data stays current automatically
- **Better UX**: Loading states and error handling improve usability
- **Reliability**: Connection monitoring ensures data integrity
- **Performance**: Efficient data fetching with proper cleanup

## 🔍 Review Checklist
- [x] **Code follows Flutter best practices**
- [x] **Real-time updates working correctly**
- [x] **Error handling comprehensive**
- [x] **Loading states implemented properly**
- [x] **Connection status monitoring functional**
- [x] **Stats calculations accurate**
- [x] **Memory leaks prevented** (Timer cleanup)
- [x] **User experience enhanced**

## 📸 Screenshots
The mechanics page now shows:
- Real appointment counts for today
- Actual earnings calculations for the week
- Connection status indicators
- Loading states during data fetching
- Error handling with retry options

## 🎉 Result
Mechanics now have access to accurate, real-time data about their performance and upcoming appointments, with a robust user experience that handles connectivity issues gracefully.
