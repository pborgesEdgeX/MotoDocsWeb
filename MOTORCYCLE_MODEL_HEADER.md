## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Use Case: Multi-Model Comparison
```
User selects: Sportster 2010
User asks: "How do I change the oil?"

🏍️ MOTORCYCLE: Sportster 2010
📋 DIAGNOSIS: Oil change interval is 5,000 miles...
[Response specific to Sportster 2010]

---

User switches to: Dyna 2016
User asks: "How do I change the oil?"

🏍️ MOTORCYCLE: Dyna 2016
📋 DIAGNOSIS: Oil change interval is 7,500 miles...
[Response specific to Dyna 2016]
```

**Now users can easily see the difference!**

### Benefits
- ✅ **Clear context** - Know which model each response is about
- ✅ **Easy comparison** - See differences when switching models
- ✅ **Chat history** - Review previous responses and know the context
- ✅ **Prevent confusion** - No ambiguity about which manual was referenced

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ChatMessage Model Update
```dart
class ChatMessage {
  final String text;
  final bool isUser;
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final double? confidence;
  final String? bikeModel;  // NEW: Added bike model field

  ChatMessage({
    required this.text,
    required this.isUser,
    required this.timestamp,
    this.confidence,
    this.bikeModel,  // NEW: Optional bike model
  });
}
```

### Response Formatting
```dart
String _formatRagResponse(Map<String, dynamic> result) {
  StringBuffer buffer = StringBuffer();

  // NEW: Motorcycle Model (always shown at top)
  if (_selectedBikeModel.isNotEmpty) {
    buffer.writeln('🏍️ MOTORCYCLE: $_selectedBikeModel');
    buffer.writeln();
  }

  // Diagnosis
  if (result.containsKey('diagnosis')) {
    buffer.writeln('📋 DIAGNOSIS:');
    buffer.writeln(result['diagnosis']);
    buffer.writeln();
  }

  // ... rest of formatting
}
```

### Message Creation
```dart
_messages.add(
  ChatMessage(
    text: formattedResponse,
    isUser: false,
    timestamp: DateTime.now(),
    confidence: result['confidence']?.toDouble(),
    bikeModel: _selectedBikeModel, // NEW: Store bike model with message
  ),
);
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

The motorcycle model appears as a **prominent header** with:
- 🏍️ **Motorcycle emoji** for visual identification
- **Bold label** "MOTORCYCLE:"
- **Model name** in standard text
- **Blank line separator** before diagnosis

This makes it immediately clear which model the response is about, even when scrolling through long chat histories.

2. Ask "What oil to use?"
3. See response with header: `🏍️ MOTORCYCLE: Sportster 2010`

### Test Scenario 2: Model Switching
1. Select "Dyna 2016"
2. Ask "Oil capacity?"
3. See: `🏍️ MOTORCYCLE: Dyna 2016`
4. Switch to "Sportster 2010"
5. Ask same question
6. See: `🏍️ MOTORCYCLE: Sportster 2010`
7. **Scroll up** - Previous response still shows Dyna 2016

### Test Scenario 3: Chat History Review
```
[Earlier in chat]
🏍️ MOTORCYCLE: Sportster 1970-1978
📋 DIAGNOSIS: Points ignition timing...

[Later in chat]
