# 🚨 Quick Sign Out Test

## What We Added:
1. ✅ Console logs when menu opens
2. ✅ Console logs when "Sign Out" is clicked
3. ✅ **ORANGE SNACKBAR** appears when sign out starts
4. ✅ **GREEN SNACKBAR** appears when sign out completes
5. ✅ Detailed console logs throughout the process

---

## Test Now:

### 1. Run the app (if not already running):
```bash
cd /Users/pauloborges/dev/flutter_projects/motodocs_web
flutter run -d chrome
```

### 2. Open Chrome DevTools Console (F12)

### 3. Click the menu button (⋮) in the top right
   - **Look for:** `📋 Building popup menu items` in console

### 4. Click "Sign Out"
   - **Look for:** 
     - `🔘 PopupMenu item selected: signout` in console
     - `🔘 Sign out menu item matched, calling _signOut()` in console
     - **ORANGE snackbar** appears saying "🚪 Signing out..."
     - `🚪 SIGN OUT INITIATED` in console
     - **GREEN snackbar** appears saying "✅ Sign out successful..."

---

## What Should Happen:

### ✅ IF IT WORKS:
1. Orange snackbar appears
2. Green snackbar appears
3. You see the auth/login screen

### ❌ IF IT DOESN'T WORK:
**Scenario A:** NO snackbars appear at all
- The button click isn't registering
- Check console for `🔘 PopupMenu item selected`

**Scenario B:** Orange snackbar appears, NO green snackbar
- Sign out is starting but failing
- Check console for error messages

**Scenario C:** Both snackbars appear, but you stay on home screen
- Sign out completes but UI doesn't update
- This is the StreamBuilder issue
- Check console for AuthWrapper rebuild logs

---

## Try it now and tell me:
1. Do you see the ORANGE snackbar?
2. Do you see the GREEN snackbar?
3. What do you see in the console?
4. Does the screen change?

This will tell us EXACTLY where the problem is!
