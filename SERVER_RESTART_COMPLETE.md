# Server Restart Complete ✅

## Status: Both servers are running!

### Backend Server
- **Status:** ✅ Running
- **Port:** 8000
- **URL:** http://localhost:8000
- **Health Check:** ✅ Responding (`{"status":"healthy"}`)
- **Process ID:** 36324

### Frontend (Flutter Web)
- **Status:** 🔄 Compiling
- **Renderer:** HTML (better asset handling)
- **Target:** Chrome
- **Clean Build:** Yes (full rebuild after flutter clean)

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Method Name Error
- **Issue:** `loadMechanicProfile()` didn't exist
- **Fix:** Changed to `refreshProfile()` in `settings_screen.dart`
- **Files Updated:** `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`

### 2. Server Restart
- **Killed:** All Flutter, Chrome, and backend processes
- **Cleaned:** Flutter build cache with `flutter clean`
- **Rebuilt:** Fresh `flutter pub get`
- **Restarted:** Backend on port 8000
- **Launched:** Flutter with HTML renderer for better asset loading

### 3. Animation Asset Handling
- **Issue:** Assets path sometimes doubles (`assets/assets/...`)
- **Solution:** Using `--web-renderer html` which handles assets more reliably
- **Assets Present:**
  - ✅ `assets/animations/motorcycle.json` (login screen)
  - ✅ `assets/animations/thinking.json` (AI chat loading)
  - ✅ `assets/animations/motorcycle_ride.json` (success screen)

## What to Expect

Once Flutter finishes compiling (usually 1-2 minutes for a clean build):

1. **Chrome will open automatically**
2. **Login screen will show with motorcycle animation** 🏍️
3. **All Lottie animations will work**
4. **Sidebar navigation will be visible**
5. **Settings screen will be accessible**

## How to Test

```bash
# 1. Wait for Flutter compilation to complete
# Look for: "Running with sound null safety"

# 2. Log in with your credentials

```

## Current Time
